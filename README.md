# Design Pattern: Abstract Factory

A sample application to learn and play around with a C++ implementation of the abstract factory pattern.

TODO:
* Automated travis build
* What problem does abstract factory solve
* What aspects are explored here?
  * C++ factory.make() return type and ownership (smart pointers)
  * Tradeoff: Type safety vs. independent deployablilits (see Uncle Bob)
* Highlight use case: New requirements come in... now we only have to change the plugin side

# Contributions

Yes! Help me make this sample application more ideomatic modern C++, more robuts, easier to read... just create a pull request.
